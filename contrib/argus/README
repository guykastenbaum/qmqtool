Simply add the line:
exec .1.3.6.1.4.1.18689.1.69 qcheck /script/qmqtool -s -Q
to the end of your Net-SNMP's /usr/local/share/snmp/snmpd.conf file,
accounting for which path you've placed the qmqtool script in.

go get argus, (http://argus.tcp4me.com), install and configure it.

copy the config in contrib/argus/config into your config. Optionally,
uncomment "graph: yes" to enable graphing and, optionally,
"barstyle: none" to make the results more clear.
