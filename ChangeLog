1.15   * detect if ls and grep are in path at configure time
       * added a man page in v1.14
       * more support for bigtodo (like mediatemple provisions)

1.14   * changed english and added Total on qmqtool -s
       * added more stats with qmqtool -s -V
       * modified some regexs to be arithmetic instead
       * changed string finding code:
         increased speed
         removed fallback routine
         use grep -E (egrep) when /pattern/ is used
         support case insensitive search with /pattern/i
       * rely on PATH instead of statically searching
       * improved queue consistency check
       * -[lRTLx] /displays/ calculated size
       * added -x feature for extended information on a message
       * created ./configure ; make ; make install process
         (even though we're just a light perl script)

1.13   * micro optimizations
       * refactored code that perl -w complained about
       * fixed todo/intd/bounce mkdir bug when restoring a queue
         (Thanks Josef Bergmann!)

1.12   * add -S for seeing bytes queued per dest ipaddr (similar to -i)

1.11   * declare messages only in mess/ rogue during consistency check
       * support verbose (-V) with -i
       * decided not to implement "holding queue"

1.10   * fixed envelope recipient statuses using -L and -R
         (incorrectly interpreted qmail-remote documentation as
          being correct for /var/qmail/queue/remote/x/y)

1.09   * allowed -Q with -o and -f (prints the number of messages
         found, instead of a list of messages found)
       * removed verbose output from -e and -u (when no verbose output
         was asked for, and no messages in queue)
       * todo messages can no longer be expired (we really deleted
         them anyway)
       * fixed problem where -f 'this|or|that' didnt work if using [a
         capable] grep

1.089  * fixed grep bug re-introduced in 1.08 (that was accounted
         for in 1.04) - searching through big queues
         (Thanks, Paul Annesley!)
       * fixed bug in todo statistics (accidentaly multiplied todo
         messages by conf-split)
       * changed behavior of qmqtool -i -Q when no messages queued
         (previously reported "no messages in queue" instead of "0")

1.08   * fixed bug causing both grep and internal searching routine
         to sometimes be ran while using -f (was a huge slowdown -
         evident since v1.04)
       * prefer /usr/local/bin/grep over /bin/grep -- otherwise use
         internal searching routine 
       * removed taint code that causes some versions of Perl to
         segfault while expiring over 6128 messages at a time
       * modified several taint regexs to run faster

1.07   * general code speedup
       * built internal sorting mechanism to elminate "sort" 
         command dependancy (for while using -i)
       * "grep" and "ps" are no longer searched for, they must
         be specified at the top of qmqtool.
       * moved from http://jeremy.kister.net/code/perl/qmqtool/ to
         http://jeremy.kister.net/code/qmqtool/

1.061  * removed perl 5.6+ dependancy, allowing 5.x compatibility.

1.06   * added option to only show messages older than -o hours (for
         expiring, unexpiring, and deleting)
       * added -w option to conjoin -v for viewing the whole message
         (instead of the first 100 lines)
       * fixed queue restore logic to work all of the time
         (with 0 bug reports, i guess no one restores their queues...)
       * updated queue integrity checking logic
       * updated logic surrounding queue basics
         (inode % conf-split = split-subdir)
       * changed prime number checking method from regexp to math

1.05   * dealt with grep finding binary data in queued messages
         (e.g. null character)

1.041  * check for queue life time in $qmail/control/queuelifetime
         instead of assuming 2 weeks
       * adjustments to queue restore logic (queue != maildir :) )

1.04   * added 'qmail' variable for installs not homed in /var/qmail
       * overhauled delete, expire, unexpire, and find functionality
         to deal with very large queues (>20,000 or so messages)
       * allowed combinations of previously seperate syntax, such as:
         qmqtool -e -f 'invoked for bounce'
         (qmqtool -e `qmqtool -f 'STRING'` no longer recommended)
       * most -f code moved into find_msgs sub
       * fixed -f grep functionality when only 1 message in queue
       * -f code reverts to internal searching routine automatically,
         when/if grep fails.
       * fixed bogus 'not found' errors while expiring some messages
       * changed several things that perl -wTc complained about,
         and re-factored -f & -[lLRT]Q output code to be more perlish.
         (Thanks, Gary Richardson!!)

1.03   * fixed bug causing unexpire not to work correctly on all messages

1.02b  * fixed bug with new grep functionality when searching for a
         multi-word string

1.02a  * fixup on new grep functionality problem that surfaces on
         some OSes

1.02   * we try to utilize the 'grep' command for -f (much faster than
         perl for big queues)
       * stay quiet while deleting/expiring/unexpiring messages unless
         -V specified  
       * find_tools sub added to reduce repeating code
       * find_tools searches $PATH before set of static directories

1.01   * fixed up -E and -U functionality

1.0    * added -Q functionality to conjoin -l -L -R and -T

1.0RC1 * revamped todo handling to fix "cannot open/stat" warnings
         using -T

0.87b  * limited displayed fields to ~50 characters while using -l,
         -L, -R, and -T
       * added zero byte file size checking while using -c

0.86b  * included inode check of files in queue/mess while using -c

0.85b  * added ability to traverse sending path using -i (-nN)
       * added FAQ (although there's never been a question asked) :)

0.80b  * added queue backup and restore functions
       * minor ajustments to queue manipulation logic

0.73b  * fixed typo using -i (reported 172.0.0.2 instead of 127.0.0.2)
         Thanks James Cook!!

0.72b  * fixed informational bug while reporting what directories a
         file was removed from using -d
       * added -i option to show how many messages are queued per ip
       * added support for multiple envelope recipients while viewing
         queue

0.65b  * Added 'delete' functionality
       * Corrected syntax reporting in -v, -e, and -u
        (exited instead of printing error on some syntax)
       * Corrected minor typos in informational only text

0.64b  * Initial Testing Release
